	<h2>Introduction</h2>‭ 
	  <p>
	  </p>

	<h3>My In-laws‭</h3> 
	
	<h4>Beware Evangelicals</h4>
	
	<p>James and Sarah, who prefer Andy and Sarah, are my in-laws. Pardon me when I confuse and switch James and Andy names for the single individual. Back to James and Sarah, they are the typical ordinary appearing couple with three children, two new cars, a boat, and a 4 bedroom 3 bathroom home in a posh suburban neighborhood. Andy "felt called" to do missionary work with GMOs. </p>

	<p>Whenever I hear: "I'm called to ...," and "I feel called to ...," I think uh hu, yup.  Called on your smart phone?  What was the caller's number?  Can you show me that?  The called business seems like an 'out' -- a way to do something without taking personal responsibility for one's actions.  Or maybe they believe they have a direct line to God.  Too bad for all those people without smart phones.  They do exist.</p>

	<p>Anyway, my called brother-in-law decided he needed a Master degree from a Christian college first.  So, he left his job, sold his house, and spent a year attending (and paying for) school.  Sounds so good, but there are few incongruous items. Nothing seemed really specific.  Work with who and where after graduating?  Everyone moved into a giant mansion and they kept all their accumulated material goods. During his school year, his family took multiple trips through the USA and ___.  James, Sarah, and their children lived a life of luxury.  Where does the $$ come from?</p>

	<!-- say something about the church members who help them pack and load the moving truck; note month and presence of the pandemic   -->

	<p>The school year ended <em>without</em> James having a job.  Undaunted, the family moved to another 4 bedroom house on a waterfront in Wisconsin.  Andy and Sarah </p>
	
	
	

	<h4>But mommy I don't want to wear a mask!</h4>
	
	  <p> Here's another rant about people who don't wear masks.  I'll mostly pick on my family, but first and fast, let's deal with the just plain ignorant. </p>
	  <p>There is a subset of the population that put their "rights and freedoms" as the basis for refusal to wear a mask.  That claim is a bit selfish and self-centered.  However, it is not all about you.  If you wish to live alone on an island, sure.  Plus, if no one else is there, what is the risk of catching and spreading COVID?  

	<p> When you live in a society, you accept limitations, controls, and obligations. You know, things like you can't go into an elementary school shoot and kill all the teachers and children. You may want to do that.  You may claim you can do what you want to do - "it's a free country".  Maybe you want to engage in sexual activities and give everyone herpes. That's not nice (referring to the two examples) AND those behaviors are not accepted by society. There are rules about shooting children.  There are rules about sex and intentionally spreading venerial disease.
</p> 
	<p> Make sense?  So, to attend an institution of learning, there is nothing wrong with requiring measles immunization.  People live in dorms with close social contact, people attend classes with group contact. You don't want an epidemic and its adverse consequences.  Not only that reasonable assessment, there have been epidemics in college dorms and subsequent adverse health consequences. Why those institutions were tolerant of anti-vaxers, does not make sense.  Having a few local outbreaks of measles changed the laissez-faire attitude of institutions.  
</p>
	<p> Well, here we are again.  Don't the anti-vaxers and anti-maskers realize the danger they pose to others?  If they want to take the chance of infection, fine.  But, it does not end there.  They transmit the virus to others and adversely affect others' health.  Selfish. Thoughtless.  Completely uncaring and stupid.  You don't have the right to do anything you want.  No one is doing much regulating here and maybe that is why we lead the world with infections and deaths.  That should be more alarming considering we are not the most populous country. Too bad these individuals don't live on otherwise deserted islands.  Too bad politics is triumphing the institution of health regulations.   
</p>

	<p> Quite naturally, my relatives believe they do not have to be concerned about becoming infected or infecting others.  Mom is a christian counselor - has her workdays filled in contact with patients who are in a variety of ages and health conditions.  Dad has been a pastor until he moved up to become a public representative of the church, meeting with groups of people, lecturing, and lobbying for his religious ideology. The point being that both have contact during their work life with many people. The two of them belong to another category of dangerous people.  Yes, the evangelical christians. The holy rollers.  Jesus is going to protect them.  What does that mean?  Jesus is not going to protect others?  Jesus doesn't care about newborns? Jesus wants millions to suffer and die? Jesus doesn't seem nice at all if any of that is true. </P
	<p>They are certain Jesus is going to protect them.  What conceit.  They can do whatever they want because they believe god is going to take care of them.  Yes, they are worthy.  Wait, no they aren't.  What is Jesus going to do if they drive the wrong direction on a crowded highway wearing blindfolds? Will Jesus protect them then? </p>
	<p>Doesn't that sound reckless? Isn't ignoring public health recommendations, not wearing a mask when talking to people in work, not following social distance practices, group meetings, and other practices similarly reckless behavior? Their conceit astonishes me. Of course, if you catch COVID, it is because you were not a true christian.  What are you if you spread it to others? What if they get sick and don't fully recover?  Spend time in an intensive care unit? Die? Guess what I think?  THEY ARE SINNERS! </p>
	<p>I don't think being religious renders anyone privileged and society shouldn't either.  Rules, like those that exist in other countries, to enforce simple health practices should apply to everyone.</p>
	
	<h4>There is no school like home skool</h4>
	
	
	<p>Here we go again with the two crowds that cripple society and society's progress.  The "I know what's best,"it's my right" crowd and the religious crowds.  "The public school education system is a disaster," and the "I can control what they are exposed to and it is for my child's betterment."</p>

<p>Well, the public school system is a disaster.  We should be working to make positive changes there.  You should realize that part of the disaster is the parents.  The parents expect the school system to make their children knowledgeable and capable.  And, they are usually comfortable complaining to the teachers, principles, and school boards.  Dealing with these parents interferes with educating students.  Having to kiss-ass loudmouths often interferes with the normal burdens of everyday work and increases everyone's job dissatisfaction.  Part of the parenting responsibility includes being positively involved in their children's education.  That means making time to review things with them, eliminating distractions so the kid can focus on their work. Is there a supportive home environment?  Do the parents devote time to managing, observing, and supporting their education.  </p>

<p>The public education system can have some needed influences.  The mash of people provide exposure to diversity, to other cultures, other religions, alternative appearances, and alternative sexual orientations.  Of course there is bad - drugs, psychological and physical abuse for example.  The teachers also provide diversity and expertise in a variety of areas. </p>

<p>Home schooling does not expose children to the world's diversity.  The bad mentioned above often needs to be faced.  In public school you learn what to do with bullies, druggies, haters, and destructive individuals. Home schooling does not provide the diversity of subject and fails to provide expertise in a variety of areas.  One parent or set of parents do not have sufficient knowledge to teach everything.  Do you know someone who can teach music, computer programming, mathematics, English, foreign languages, art, biology, chemistry, physics, ecology, health,anthropology, sociology, political science, economics,  etc.?</p>

<p>My favorite group to pick on, largely from personal exposure, is the evangelical Christians.  Home schooling is popular with this cult.  The kids exposure is limited to being with other evangelical Christians - insulated from the world.  This group also has some weird beliefs like a literal interpretation of the bible and following rigid rules of conduct. Their "sciences" purposely denigrates or does not include evolution.  They seem to know nothing about genetics.  They seem to know next to nothing about calculus, linear algebra, quantum mechanics, general physics, physiology, organic and inorganic chemistry, etc.  Sex is a very touchy subject.  They have a particular closed minded agenda.  The parents and the children know nothing about the details of their anatomy and how everything works.  Nor do they know anything about chromosomal variations, the variety of sexual orientations among humans and among other species.  </p>
